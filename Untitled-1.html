    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the uptime on this bot?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> 24 hours a day, unless otherwise noted.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Q:</strong> Where can I make a suggestion?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Currently there are no ways of sending in suggestions through the bot. However, if you have an idea that you think is really awesome and should be in the bot, send AKV0616#9508 a direct-message on Discord.
    <br></br>
    <strong>Q:</strong> Is this bot really being updated everyday?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Almost everyday, yes. Behind the scenes, we are testing and pushing updates out to the public. Check the <a href="changelog.html">changelogs</a> page often to see when an update is released..
    <br></br>
    <strong>Q:</strong> There are two other Tornado bots on <a href="https://top.gg/search?q=Tornado">top.gg</a>. Are you affiliated with them?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> No. Those bots are maintained by other developers and have nothing to do with our bot.
    <br></br>
    <strong>Q:</strong> I was checking the METAR/TAF/ATIS on an airport and got no results. What happened?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Not every airport/strip in the world has a weather station capable of producing a METAR, TAF, etc. However, if you know your specified airport has that service, chances are it's going through maintenance.
    <br></br>
    <strong>Tornado bot is Offline.</strong><br>
    If Tornado is not responding, first check the status of the bot. If the bot is actually offline, there is more than likely an outage on our end.
    <br></br>
    <strong>Tornado bot is Slow.</strong><br>
    If the bot is being slow, one of our services is probably having an issue that only time can fix.</p>
